### Reclaiming Focus: My Two-Week Challenge

Life throws curveballs, and sometimes, we lose momentum. Last month, I had one of those moments when illness pulled me away from progress, productivity, and the path I had mapped out. It was frustrating, and that lost time had a ripple effect, slowing me down significantly. But now, as we close this month, I feel a renewed energy—a sense of urgency to regain control and move forward with laser-sharp focus.

So, I've decided to launch a two-week challenge for myself, and here's what it will look like:

### The Plan: 14 Days of Hardcore Focus

1. **Core Focus Hours**: 
   - From 8:00 AM to 6:00 PM, my commitment is total. I will disconnect from all social distractions and dedicate these hours purely to developing the app. No texts, no calls, no social scrolling—just undiluted focus.
   
2. **Evening Work**:
   - After a brief evening break, I’ll return to work after 8:00 PM. This session will be about pushing through until I’ve reached my daily productivity goals.


### The Goal: 8 Hours of Recorded Work Per Day

I’m aiming for at least 8 hours of **tracked** work time every day. This isn’t just about sitting at my desk; it’s about truly productive hours—time that drives my app forward. For 14 days straight, I will keep a close eye on my progress, and by the end, I will have a detailed account of every focused hour.


### Why I’m Doing This

It’s easy to lose confidence when life throws setbacks at you. But this challenge isn’t just about catching up on lost time; it’s about reclaiming my focus, discipline, and drive. It’s about proving to myself that I can set ambitious goals and crush them, even after a tough period. Plus, there’s a big motivator waiting for me at the finish line.


### The Reward: A Shopping Spree

If I complete this challenge and log a minimum of 8 hours of focused work daily for 14 days, I will treat myself. I’ll head out for a well-deserved shopping spree to refresh my wardrobe. New clothes, new energy, and a feeling of accomplishment that will remind me of the effort I put in to make this happen.


### Tracking My Journey

I’ll be tracking every hour, every breakthrough, and every moment of struggle along the way. This isn’t going to be easy, but I know it’s worth it. So, here’s to the next two weeks—no distractions, no excuses, just hard work, and a relentless drive to finish my app and reward myself for staying the course.

Let’s go!

Ok. So previous month I was sick and it slowed down my progress a lot. However. It's now the end of the month, so I can claim back the control of focus.

so. The next 2 weeks I am going to finish the app with hardcord focus. I will: ignore all social contact between 8h and 18h. and only work on the app. I will also work after 20h. I will record how much I am working and the goal is 8h recorded time at least a day for 14 days. When I achieve this, I will go shopping and buy myself new clothes as a present.

can you put this in a nice blog
