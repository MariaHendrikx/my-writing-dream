# It's 2025... !

So... It's 2025. What do we want to achieve in this new year? Since I graduated, I am more focused on money and businesses. I am mainly focused on financial freedom. And I am quite convinced I will soon have it. I just need to continue whatever I am doing.

I am currently building AI Story Book. It's basically publishable, but I am not yet ready to do it. I want to be sure and feel ready for it. I think I need to add like 1 or 2 more things, and then it is really ready.

Personally I think, that once I start advertisement for this, it will be a success. In the beginning it will be expensive, but the price will be reduced and people will want it.
