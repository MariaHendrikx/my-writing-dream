# The Last Bits

Last week was productive, but not quite as intense as the first week. Honestly, that was expected—the first week was a powerhouse, and I figured the pace would naturally ease up.

### Sleep Troubles

Something that really started to frustrate me this week was my sleep. One of my main goals for this productivity challenge was to improve my sleep routine and create a more rhythmic schedule. In the first week, I avoided using my phone after 10:30 PM, but even then, I couldn’t fall asleep until 2 or 3 AM. Obviously, this makes waking up at 8 AM a challenge—I’m tired before the day even starts. And I don’t want to sleep past 10 AM because that feels like I’ve already lost part of the day, so I end up starting off a little annoyed. The goal is simple: better rhythm, better sleep.

On the bright side, I’ve recently been waking up around 7:40 AM. I used to sleep right through my alarm, but now I’m actually getting up, and while I still feel a bit tired, I’m feeling more energized than before. Progress!

### What’s the Plan for This Week?

#### App Progress

This Friday, I aim to have everything ready for testing. Right now, I’ve got the first "working" version of the app, but I wouldn’t let anyone test it yet—it’s still a bit rough, and some basic features aren’t functioning the way I want them to. But I’m confident I’ll have that polished by Friday. Once that’s done, I’ll shift to implementing the payment system. If the text-editing feature doesn’t work through my own library by then, I’ll consider using a well-rated one from GitHub, though I’d really prefer sticking to my own solution.

#### Rule Adjustments

Let’s talk about the rules for this week. Initially, I set a rule about not using my phone or messaging services during the day, but I’ve realized that going from 9 AM to 7 PM without checking anything felt too restrictive. So, I’m tweaking things a bit to make them more manageable while still sticking to the core goals.

Here’s a recap of the original daily goals:

What I’m not allowed to do this month:

- No Facebook, Instagram, X (formerly Twitter), or TikTok.

- My computer automatically shuts off between 10:30 PM and 6:00 AM.
- No games.

What I should do every day:

- Eat breakfast between 6:00 AM and 9:00 AM.
- Eat lunch between 11:00 AM and 1:00 PM.
- Eat dinner between 5:00 PM and 7:00 PM.
- Work for at least two 2-hour sessions on my app.
```

And for this week, I’m adding these extra focus points:

What I should do every day:

- No phone between 9 AM and 4 PM.

That’s the plan. Let’s get to it.
