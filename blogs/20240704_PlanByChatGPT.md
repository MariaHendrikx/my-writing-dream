# Let's ask ChatGPT for a plan!

Alright... So, I need a plan to be productive, but I always fail in executing the plan. Probably because I am a bit too enthousiastic at the beginning and then get burned out. So, for the next 2 weeks I will try to follow the plan that ChatGPT proposes for me. I will also post their plan down below, and I will try to update everyday for the next 2 weeks on how the plan is going.

# The plan

```
** My Question to ChatGPT ** : 

Can you make me a detailed, concise 2-week plan to be productive and make at least one app (web dev)?

On my to-do list is to finish my portfolio website. I think I should be able to finish it in 2 days, and I would like to write every day in my blog. Additionally, I want to start creating a web app for toddlers.
