# Minimalism

Why this blog post? I was reflecting on myself as a person and realized how my entrepreneurial journey has allowed me to discover who I really am. I wanted to share these thoughts because the process has not only been about building products but also about understanding my values, passions, and how I want to live.

### Finding My Niche: AI Toddler Stories

Currently, I'm working on AI Toddler Stories, and it has made me reflect on why this idea feels so right. In many ways, this project is also part of a journey of self-discovery. It blends my love for writing, storytelling, creativity, and computer science—all the elements that make me feel most like myself. Bringing this project to life feels deeply rewarding because it reflects who I am and what I care about. I know I’m on the right path when I can say that AI Toddler Stories is something I would genuinely use, and creating it makes me feel fulfilled.

This journey has also shown me that my passion lies in storytelling, and I see myself continuing in this direction long-term. Whether it's through AI Toddler Stories, another app, or even exploring new creative formats, the chance is high I will expand on this theme.

As I look back, I realize that Toddler Stories is actually just a product of what I like in general: the desire of storytelling. You sometimes read these "I always wanted to be ... since a child". Well. I wanted to be a writer as a child. To this day, I still want to be a writer, though I don't want to pursue writing full-time. I want to write, when it feels right. Starting this blog has been part of that journey, a reminder that I can express myself and share my story on my own terms.


### The Influence of Minimalism

Another topic central to both my work and my life is minimalism. It’s interesting to see how this philosophy has guided my design choices, both in my products and in my personal branding.

Another topic that is quite central in my design of the product I want to create is minimalism. The name of my first company was "RedAndWhiteApps", and I feel like this was a runner-up to the minimalism I am thriving now for in my apps. Because, RedAndWhiteApps tells you that it will use two colors only: the color red, and white. It reduces excess and creates something that stands out without being overwhelming. It was, in a sense, my early exploration into minimalism.

However, now that I am redoing my company, I want a bit more freedom and the name "RedAndWhiteApps" does limit me a little bit. Which is why I want to change the name to something more broad and that captures really what I actually want: minimalism! -- I am still searching for a name btw.

### What is a minimalist

This realization that minimalism is a huge part of my design, made me search what is "minimalism"? 

A minimalist is someone who embraces minimalism, which is a lifestyle or design philosophy that focuses on simplicity and reducing excess. In lifestyle terms, a minimalist tends to eliminate non-essential possessions and activities to focus on what brings true value and joy. In design, minimalism emphasizes clean lines, simplicity, and the use of limited colors or elements to create uncluttered, functional spaces or objects. The core idea is to strip away the unnecessary to highlight what is most important.

This definition resonates a lot with me, and without wanting to be one, I think I might just be a minimalist by nature.

### Minimalism in Product Design

Minimalism isn’t just an abstract idea for me—it’s a core principle that shapes how I create products. For example, in AI Toddler Stories, I’m focusing on a simple and user-friendly interface. I want parents to be able to create stories for their children effortlessly, without dealing with unnecessary features or a confusing interface. Every button, every interaction, every screen should have a purpose. If it doesn’t add to the experience, it doesn’t belong.

# Conclusion

Minimalism is not just about reducing things; it’s about creating space for what matters. Whether in my personal life, where I strive to focus on meaningful activities, or in my product designs, where I cut away anything unnecessary, minimalism helps me highlight the essence of what’s important. As I continue my entrepreneurial adventure, I want to carry this philosophy forward—to build products that are not just functional, but also enriching, easy to use, and focused on what truly matters.
