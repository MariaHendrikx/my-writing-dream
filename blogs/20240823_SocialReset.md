# Socially Resetting

Today, I decided to embark on a social reset. For the next month, I will be stepping away from Facebook, Instagram, and all other social media platforms. Additionally, I've noticed that I’ve been chatting a bit too much for my liking, so I will also stop initiating texts and emails with people for the entire month. To ensure that I stick to this plan, I’ll be using the Cold Turkey app. I plan to test it for a week, and if it works well, I'll purchase it and continue using it throughout the month.

The goal of this reset is simple: to stop overthinking and become more productive.

Since COVID-19, I haven’t created a single app as a side project. I’ve been busy studying, moving around, exploring new places, and working, but personal projects have taken a back seat. Despite having a head full of ideas and telling people about all the cool projects I want to work on, I haven’t actually made any of them a reality.

I’ve been reflecting on why that is, and I believe it comes down to a lack of structure since the pandemic. I also made the decision to be more social and make new friends. Before this, I had a very small circle of friends and was completely content with it. Interestingly, I’ve noticed that as I’ve expanded my social circle, I’ve also started to overthink more. So, it’s time to get back to the environment that worked for me before—fewer friends, less overthinking, and more structure.

To help with this, I’ve installed the Cold Turkey app, which blocks websites and restricts computer usage during specific hours. A friend of mine swears by it and says the app is pretty hardcore. So, let's test it out!

Alright, enough mental preparation. It's time to get something done in the last two hours before my laptop shuts off!
