# Playing by Chance

I play a lot of Dota, and one thing I've noticed is that losing never really bothers me. If I lose, I just think, "Well... next time I'll win. I'm only getting better." There's no sadness or frustration—just a mindset of continuous improvement. But recently, I started playing a new game: [Colonist](https://colonist.io), and losing in this game *really* gets under my skin. This made me wonder: why does losing in Colonist frustrate me, while losing in Dota (or even sports) doesn’t?

Thinking deeper, I realized there’s another game that gives me the same feeling of frustration: Monopoly. Whenever I lose in Monopoly, I feel a similar sense of annoyance. So, what’s different about these games compared to Dota or sports?

I believe it all comes down to *luck and control.*

In Colonist and Monopoly, no matter how skilled you are, the dice can work against you. You could be the best player in the world, but if the rolls aren’t in your favor, you can still lose. That feeling of helplessness—where your skill isn’t always rewarded—can be frustrating.

On the other hand, in Dota or sports, if you train hard and master the game, you will *almost always* win against less-skilled opponents. While luck does play a role in both, it’s barely noticeable compared to the overwhelming influence of skill. In these games, improvement leads to more consistent victories, which makes losing feel less like a random punishment and more like a learning experience.

So, is frustration with losing really just about luck? Or is it more about feeling like our effort doesn’t matter? Maybe it’s also about fairness—when we lose due to skill, it feels justifiable, but when we lose due to randomness, it feels unfair.

So what did I do with this? I asked ChatGPT ofcourse to see what they think of it.

### The Psychology Behind This Frustration

This feeling of frustration when losing luck-based games isn't just random—it’s rooted in psychology. Several concepts help explain why losing in some games feels worse than in others:

#### **1. Locus of Control: Feeling in Charge vs. Powerless**
Some people have an **internal locus of control**, meaning they believe their success comes from their own actions. Others have an **external locus of control**, where outcomes feel dictated by outside forces. In skill-based games like Dota, losses feel like personal challenges—something you can improve upon. But in luck-based games, losing can feel unfair because it wasn’t entirely in your hands.

#### **2. Effort Justification & the Sunk Cost Fallacy**
When we put effort into something, we expect results. In skill-based games, effort translates to improvement and eventual success. In luck-based games, however, effort doesn’t always correlate with winning, which makes losing feel frustrating—almost like the effort was wasted.

#### **3. Perceived Fairness & the Just-World Hypothesis**
Humans crave fairness. We want the best player to win, and when luck overrides skill, it disrupts our sense of justice. When someone who played poorly wins simply because they rolled better dice, it can feel frustrating—not just because we lost, but because it *feels* unfair.

#### **4. Loss Aversion & Regret Theory**
Psychologists have found that people feel losses more intensely than they feel the joy of winning. Losing in a luck-based game can trigger this even more, because we regret things that were completely out of our control. If only the dice had rolled differently!

#### **5. The Illusion of Control**
We like to believe we have control over outcomes, even when we don’t. In a game like Colonist, we might think our strategy will decide the winner—until the dice remind us otherwise. This illusion breaking can make losing feel extra frustrating.

### Why Some People Handle Luck-Based Losses Better
Not everyone hates losing in luck-based games. Some people approach them with a different mindset:
1. **Detachment from Outcome** – They play for fun, not to win.
2. **Understanding Variance** – They accept randomness as part of the experience.
3. **Enjoyment of Chaos** – Some people actually *like* the unpredictability and the stories it creates.

But for players who are used to skill-based competition, losing to randomness can feel like a betrayal of effort.

Alright. So now we know what ChatGPT thinks of it. I am going to leave it here for now, and might touch upon it at a later time.
