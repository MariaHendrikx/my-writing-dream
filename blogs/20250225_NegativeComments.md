# Negative Comments

Today I was thinking to write about the struggles of getting negative commentary, why people give it and what it means or how to interpret it. And most importantly... how to get the most out of it.

I have noticed that there are different reasons why people might make negative remarkts and these include:
- Jealousy
- People project their own limitations
- Criticism as a Form of Control

### **Jealousy: A Hidden Struggle**  

Reflecting on negative comments, I’ve realized that jealousy has played a significant role in some of the criticism I’ve received. It’s not something people openly admit—no one says, *"Oh, I’m jealous of you."* But the signs are there. Neither can a person being the victim of jealousy say *"Oh, this person is jealous of me"*, because it sounds like humble bragging. Even writing this article I feel a little bit like as if I am humble bragging, but I am not. Yes, it is a compliment in one way that someone is jealous of you, but the consequences of someone being jealous of you are so hard. It really defined a sad and hard part of my life.

I am writing this article such that other people can accept that sometimes it's ok to conclude that someone is jealous of them. And how to use it to your advantage, **without becoming the asshole yourself**. I am also writing it for myself, to reflect on it.

#### **Jealousy in School and University**: My experience  

Throughout both high school and university, I noticed a pattern—some people would criticize me while simultaneously mimicking what I did. In high school, a classmate constantly pointed out my flaws while copying my extracurriculars and academic efforts. In university, the same happened with peers who dismissed my work as *wrong* or *too easy*, yet offered no logical critique. When I built well-designed apps, instead of constructive feedback, I received baseless negativity—ignoring the fact that my work was objectively solid.  


#### **Understanding Jealousy**  
Over time, I noticed a trend: whenever I did something *well*, certain people would go out of their way to be negative. At first, I couldn’t understand why. But looking back, I now recognize it for what it was—jealousy.  

I’ve only encountered *three* people in my life who were jealous of me, that I noticed. One was in high school, and I had no way to fully avoid it due to the environment. Another was more manageable because I could simply remove myself from their presence. The third was only mildly jealous, so it never became a major problem.

> What I’ve learned is that jealousy often masquerades as subtle put-downs. It can be difficult to identify because it doesn’t always come with obvious hostility—it might be disguised as *"helpful advice"*, *sarcasm*, or *harsh criticism*. 

Understanding that jealousy, at its core, comes from people feeling threatened by what you’re capable of has helped me reframe the negative.


### **People project their own limitations**

Beyond jealousy, another type of negative comment I’ve noticed comes from **people projecting their own limitations** onto others.  

For example, I’m confident in my ability to build a successful business and generate substantial income from it. However, when I share this belief with certain people—especially those who don’t see entrepreneurship as a viable path—I often hear responses like:  
- *"But that already exists"*  
- *"I mean, sure, you can try… but don’t get your hopes up."*  
- *"You need connections/money/luck to succeed in that."*  

Another example is when I want to achieve top level in something. For instance, sometimes I regret not having achieved much in sports, despite being completely capable of it. However, I can't say this out loud, because whenever I say "I want to participate in the world championships of a sport" People respond I am crazy. I believe I can achieve this, of course with the needed training (meaning, endless hours), and yes I know it's not guaranteed. But you can never achieve something without trying... But when I tell people this, I often get responses like:
- *"But you need talent for that."*  

So they assume I am not capable of achieving this? They assume I don't have enough talent to achieve it. They are insinuating that I don't have any talent. While they have never seen me do the sport itself..

The pattern I noticed? They can't do it, they don't see themselves having the talent to achieve it. So they say that out loud, projecting at you. 

> If someone **can’t** picture themselves achieving something, they assume **you can’t either**. Because they see you as a real person—someone they know, not a distant, larger-than-life person—it’s harder for them to believe that you could succeed. Their doubt isn’t necessarily about you; it’s about their **own inability to see what’s possible**.  

Understanding this has helped me not take these comments personally. Instead of seeing them as discouraging, I now recognize them as a reflection of *their* perspective, not *my* potential.

### **Criticism as a Form of Control**

Another form of criticism comes from **a desire to control others**. While I don’t fully understand why some people do this, I suspect it often stems from **jealousy and insecurity**.  

In many areas of life—whether in business, academics, or social circles—some people want to **maintain their position at the top**. Naturally, as more talented and capable individuals rise, their status could be threatened. At this point, they have two options:  
1. **Improve themselves** to stay ahead.  
2. **Hold others back** so they don’t have to compete.  

Some people choose the **second** option. Instead of growing, they resort to **tearing others down**—not with constructive feedback, but with **strategic negativity** designed to plant self-doubt. If they can make you question yourself, hesitate, or feel unworthy, you might never reach your full potential, ensuring they **stay ahead without having to improve**.  

What makes this so powerful is the **psychological impact** it has on a person’s actual abilities. **Skills are not just about talent or practice—they are also deeply affected by belief and confidence.** If someone repeatedly hears that they’re bad at something, they may begin to internalize that belief, even if it isn’t true. Over time, **this doubt erodes their actual skill level** because they start hesitating, overthinking, or avoiding challenges altogether.  

This phenomenon is similar to the **self-fulfilling prophecy**—if people are constantly told they aren’t good enough, they may unconsciously act in ways that make it true. They stop putting in effort, they second-guess themselves, and eventually, they perform worse than they otherwise would have.  

### Sidenote:  **Not Everyone Thinks Like You—And That’s Hard to Accept**  

I've experienced small moments of **jealousy**, but they’ve always been brief—more of a passing thought than something that sticks. If I see someone win a competition, I might think:  

*"I wish I were standing on that podium."*  

But within **30 minutes**, that feeling fades, and I recognize that they deserved it. Instead of resenting them, I take it as **motivation to improve** for the next time. To me, that’s how jealousy should work—it should push you to **grow**, not pull others down.  

The same goes for the **other two types of negativity**—**projecting insecurities** and **using criticism as control**. I **don’t see myself doing these things at all**, which makes it hard for me to understand why people would.  

People tend to **understand the world based on what they would do themselves**. If I wouldn’t sabotage someone out of jealousy, I naturally assume others wouldn’t either.

At first, I tried to **rationalize** it—maybe they didn’t mean it, maybe I misunderstood. But over time, I realized that **some people do operate this way**, and there’s no point in trying to make sense of it.  

At some point, you just have to **accept that it happens**, even if it doesn’t fit into your own way of thinking. Understanding *why* people do it isn’t as important as **recognizing it, not letting it affect you, and moving forward anyway**.
