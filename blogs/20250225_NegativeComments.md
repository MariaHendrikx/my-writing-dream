# Negative Comments

Today I was thinking to write about the struggles of getting negative commentary, why people give it and what it means or how to interpret it.

I have noticed that there are different reasons why people might make negative remarkt, and these include:
- Jealousy
- People project their own limitations
- Criticism as a Form of Control

### **Jealousy: A Hidden Struggle**  

Reflecting on negative comments, I’ve realized that jealousy has played a significant role in some of the criticism I’ve received. It’s not something people openly admit—no one says, *"Oh, I’m jealous of you."* But the signs are there.  

One of the most telling signs of jealousy is when someone constantly tears down your work, especially when you’re excelling at something. It’s frustrating because, on the surface, their words may sound like *criticism*, but underneath, it often comes from their own insecurity.  

#### **Jealousy in High School**  
During high school, I had a classmate who was clearly jealous of me. The strange part? She would constantly criticize everything I did—yet, at the same time, she would *copy* me.  

For example, I was involved in many hobbies outside of school, and soon after, she started doing multiple extracurricular activities too. I was good at math, and while she was also talented in math, she would put effort into pointing out moments where she performed better than me while simultaneously telling me I was *bad* at it.  

It was confusing. On one hand, she acted as if I wasn’t good enough, yet on the other hand, she was mirroring everything I did.  

#### **Jealousy in University**  
A similar pattern repeated in university. I would be working on lecture exercises when, out of nowhere, someone would criticize my approach, claiming I was doing it *wrong* or taking the *easy* way out.  

When I built well-designed apps that looked better than theirs, instead of constructive feedback or compliments, they would tear them apart with excessive criticism—ignoring the fact that, objectively, the apps were actually quite well-made. Also the criticism they gave, didn't make sense at all.  

#### **Understanding Jealousy**  
Over time, I noticed a trend: whenever I did something *well*, certain people would go out of their way to be negative. At first, I couldn’t understand why. But looking back, I now recognize it for what it was—jealousy.  

I’ve only encountered *three* people in my life who were jealous of me, that I noticed. One was so extreme that I had no way to defend myself or escape the situation. Another was still intense but more manageable because I could simply remove myself from their presence. The third was only mildly jealous, so it never became a major problem.  

What I’ve learned is that jealousy often masquerades as harsh criticism. It can be difficult to identify because it doesn’t always come with obvious hostility—it might be disguised as *"helpful advice"*, *sarcasm*, or *subtle put-downs*. But at its core, jealousy stems from people feeling threatened by what you’re capable of.  


### **People projecting their own limitations**

Beyond jealousy, another type of negative comment I’ve noticed comes from **people projecting their own limitations** onto others.  

For example, I’m confident in my ability to build a successful business and generate substantial income from it. However, when I share this belief with certain people—especially those who don’t see entrepreneurship as a viable path—I often hear responses like:  
- *"But that already exists"*  
- *"I mean, sure, you can try… but don’t get your hopes up."*  
- *"You need connections/money/luck to succeed in that."*  

At first, these comments might seem like feedback, but I’ve come to realize that they often have **nothing to do with me**. Instead, these people are speaking from their **own mindset and limitations**.  

If someone **can’t** picture themselves achieving something, they assume **you can’t either**. Because they see me as a real person—someone they know, not a distant, larger-than-life entrepreneur—it’s harder for them to believe that I could succeed. Their doubt isn’t necessarily about me; it’s about their **own inability to see what’s possible**.  

Understanding this has helped me not take these comments personally. Instead of seeing them as discouraging, I now recognize them as a reflection of *their* perspective, not *my* potential.

### **Criticism as a Form of Control**

Another form of criticism comes from **a desire to control others**. While I don’t fully understand why some people do this, I suspect it often stems from **jealousy and insecurity**.  

In many areas of life—whether in business, academics, or social circles—some people want to **maintain their position at the top**. Naturally, as more talented and capable individuals rise, their status could be threatened. At this point, they have two options:  
1. **Improve themselves** to stay ahead.  
2. **Hold others back** so they don’t have to compete.  

Some people choose the **second** option. Instead of growing, they resort to **tearing others down**—not with constructive feedback, but with **strategic negativity** designed to plant self-doubt. If they can make you question yourself, hesitate, or feel unworthy, you might never reach your full potential, ensuring they **stay ahead without having to improve**.  

What makes this so powerful is the **psychological impact** it has on a person’s actual abilities. **Skills are not just about talent or practice—they are also deeply affected by belief and confidence.** If someone repeatedly hears that they’re bad at something, they may begin to internalize that belief, even if it isn’t true. Over time, **this doubt erodes their actual skill level** because they start hesitating, overthinking, or avoiding challenges altogether.  

This phenomenon is similar to the **self-fulfilling prophecy**—if people are constantly told they aren’t good enough, they may unconsciously act in ways that make it true. They stop putting in effort, they second-guess themselves, and eventually, they perform worse than they otherwise would have.  

# How to use this in business?

Now... these negative comments actually also have a 

## Using Negative Commentary to Validate Ideas**

Negative feedback can be **a signal** rather than an obstacle. People’s reactions can reveal **what they actually think**—sometimes more than they intend to.

### **A. If People Dismiss Your Idea, It Might Be a Good One**
- When people say **"That won’t work"** or **"That’s not possible"**, it means they can't imagine themselves how to build it or how to make it.
    - If you are looking to build something "crazy", the negativity is actually a good sign. Because it means you know something they don't.
- If people **instantly "get" your idea and love it**, it is actually **too obvious** and probably **already done**.
    - This is btw also a good sign, because it means people think of it themselves and they will search for it online.


### **B. If People Are Jealous, You're Probably Onto Something**
- Jealousy often comes from people **wishing they could do what you’re doing**.
- If people start **undermining your success** instead of giving real feedback, **it might mean you're ahead**.

### **C. If Nobody Hates It, Nobody Cares**
- The worst reaction to a product is **indifference, not hate**.
- If people argue about your idea, it means it’s **important**.


## Building a Resilient Mindset in Business**
- Entrepreneurs face negativity **constantly**. The key is **not letting it stop you**.
- The best **defense against negativity** is **traction**. If people use your product, **opinions don’t matter**.

- Train yourself to see negativity as **a data point, not a roadblock**.
- Ask: **"Is this criticism logical or emotional?"** and adjust accordingly.


# Believe in yourself
Both negative and positive comments have pros and cons. If the idea  gets a lot of positive feedback, it probably means people can imagine it themselves and are more likely to search for it or use it.

-  **Negative comments** might mean you know something they can't imagine themselves. It doesn't necessarily mean it is really bad. It is good for future ideas
-  **Positive comments** means they can imagine it themselves, which means they might search for it themselves.

You need both. If people completely can't imagine it, they won't search it, which means nobody will use your product. It means the market is not yet ready for it. VR is an example of this imo. VR and AR has a TREMENDOUS amount of potential to make life better for people. The amount of things you can create with VR/AR... 

But... In a couple of years, VR/AR will probably be a huge hit. Because people need time to see the use of something and integrate it into their lives.


# Conclusion

This is why **recognizing and rejecting this type of criticism is crucial**. If you let others define your limits, you may unknowingly lower your own potential. The best way to counter it is to **trust yourself, focus on actual results, and surround yourself with people who genuinely support growth**—not those who try to hold you back.

### Sidenote:  **Not Everyone Thinks Like You—And That’s Hard to Accept**  

I've experienced small moments of **jealousy**, but they’ve always been brief—more of a passing thought than something that sticks. If I see someone win a competition, I might think:  

*"I wish I were standing on that podium."*  

But within **30 minutes**, that feeling fades, and I recognize that they deserved it. Instead of resenting them, I take it as **motivation to improve** for the next time. To me, that’s how jealousy should work—it should push you to **grow**, not pull others down.  

The same goes for the **other two types of negativity**—**projecting insecurities** and **using criticism as control**. I **don’t see myself doing these things at all**, which makes it hard for me to understand why people would.  

People tend to **understand the world based on what they would do themselves**. If I wouldn’t sabotage someone out of jealousy, I naturally assume others wouldn’t either. But life has taught me otherwise.  

At first, I tried to **rationalize** it—maybe they didn’t mean it, maybe I misunderstood. But over time, I realized that **some people do operate this way**, and there’s no point in trying to make sense of it.  

At some point, you just have to **accept that it happens**, even if it doesn’t fit into your own way of thinking. Understanding *why* people do it isn’t as important as **recognizing it, not letting it affect you, and moving forward anyway**.
