# Negative Comments

Today I was thinking to write about the struggles of getting negative commentary, why people give it and what it means or interpret it.

I have noticed that there are different reasons why people might make negative remarkt, and these include:
- jealousy
- people project what they think of themselves
- Criticism as a Form of Control

## Jealousy

The reason I am reflecting on this is because I have had quite a few people jealous of me in my life. It is however not something you can say out loud, because then you sound "bragging", but the struggle of having someone jealous of you is real.

It is also hard to pinpoint jealousy, because nobody is going to say "oh, i am jealous of you". But signs someone is jealous I have noticed is that they tear everything down what you do, especially if you do something on a good level, better than them.

During my high school years, I had a certain person being jealous of me. How did this manifest? Everything I did, she was tearing down and saying I was horrible at it. At the same time, she was copying everything I did. I did a lot of hobbies, next to school, so she went on to do a lot of hobbies next to school. I was good at maths, so she said I was horrible at math and at the same time she was using every moment if she did something better at math then me (she was btw very good at math as well).

Another example of jealousy was in university. Where I would be doing the exercises for the lecture, and out of nowhere I would get comments on how I was doing my lectures completely wrong and in the easy way. While in their opinion I had to make each exercise 100% correct, even though I was just starting out, so ofcourse I can't make it 100% correct yet. When I made some really nice looking apps (better looking than theirs), they would critize it completely and burn it down. While in reality, the app was actually really nice.

In general, I noticed that when I did something good, I would get lots of negative comments, where I completely couldn't place why I would get them.

I have only had 3 people being jealous of me in my life, of which 1 very very hard core, and I coudln't defend myself towards it or leave the situation. One was a bit less jealous of me, but still hardcore, but I could just leave the situation, so that's fine. And the other one is only mildly jealous, so it's not a really huge problem.

## Negativity because it reflects their own.

However, besides jealous comments, another type of comments I have noticed is when people project their own failings towards you. I am quite convinced I can create my own business for instance and make quite a lot of money with it. When I say this to people that think they can't do this, they tell me: "oh, you won't succeed", or "yeah, that is not possible" or "person x is able to do this, but I don't expect you can" or something similar. 

I think in myself, I could completely do this and am quite certain about it. But when I hear these sentences, I now just realize that they don't see how to achieve it. Because they can't imagine themselves how to achieve that, they assume you can't either. Because they know me, and I am a real person for them, not some unknown celebrity, which makes them think I can't either, because I am too close to reality.

## Criticism as a Form of Control

Another form of critisism is criticism as a form of control. I personally don't understand why someone would do this, but I think it's part of the jealousy as well. Let's say that to have certain things in life, you need to be at the top. Of course, there are more people able to be as good as you. However, if they become betterthan you, you would lose your place at the top. One solution is that they become better themselves.. or... they activily prevent others to become better: so they critize you such that you feel bad about yourself and thus don't advance to a better level. If they can make you doubt yourself, you might not outgrow them, which makes them feel safer in their own insecurities. They criticize because they want to control or belittle you to keep you from advancing.

# How to use this in business?

## Using Negative Commentary to Validate Ideas**

Negative feedback can be **a signal** rather than an obstacle. People’s reactions can reveal **what they actually think**—sometimes more than they intend to.

### **A. If People Dismiss Your Idea, It Might Be a Good One**
- When people say **"That won’t work"** or **"That’s not possible"**, it means they can't imagine themselves how to build it or how to make it.
    - If you are looking to build something "crazy", the negativity is actually a good sign. Because it means you know something they don't.
- If people **instantly "get" your idea and love it**, it is actually **too obvious** and probably **already done**.
    - This is btw also a good sign, because it means people think of it themselves and they will search for it online.


### **B. If People Are Jealous, You're Probably Onto Something**
- Jealousy often comes from people **wishing they could do what you’re doing**.
- If people start **undermining your success** instead of giving real feedback, **it might mean you're ahead**.

### **C. If Nobody Hates It, Nobody Cares**
- The worst reaction to a product is **indifference, not hate**.
- If people argue about your idea, it means it’s **important**.


## Building a Resilient Mindset in Business**
- Entrepreneurs face negativity **constantly**. The key is **not letting it stop you**.
- The best **defense against negativity** is **traction**. If people use your product, **opinions don’t matter**.

- Train yourself to see negativity as **a data point, not a roadblock**.
- Ask: **"Is this criticism logical or emotional?"** and adjust accordingly.


# Believe in yourself
Both negative and positive comments have pros and cons. If the idea  gets a lot of positive feedback, it probably means people can imagine it themselves and are more likely to search for it or use it.

-  **Negative comments** might mean you know something they can't imagine themselves. It doesn't necessarily mean it is really bad. It is good for future ideas
-  **Positive comments** means they can imagine it themselves, which means they might search for it themselves.

You need both. If people completely can't imagine it, they won't search it, which means nobody will use your product. It means the market is not yet ready for it. VR is an example of this imo. VR and AR has a TREMENDOUS amount of potential to make life better for people. The amount of things you can create with VR/AR... 

But... In a couple of years, VR/AR will probably be a huge hit. Because people need time to see the use of something and integrate it into their lives.
