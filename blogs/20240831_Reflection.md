# Status Update on My Social Reset Challenge

A week ago, I embarked on a challenge to boost my productivity, and I'm excited to share my progress. The short version? I was super productive—at least at the start. But as the week wore on, I found myself doing less and less. Today, I'm feeling pretty exhausted, which tells me I might have overdone it. My goal is to find a balance where I can work around six hours a day, squeeze in some exercise, and stick to my schedule without burning out.

### Reflecting on My Rules

One of the rules I set was no phone use between 7:00 AM and 8:00 PM. Surprisingly, this worked well. It helped me focus less on what others were doing and more on my tasks. Plus, it was nice to catch up socially after 8:00 PM. However, I realized that starting my downtime at 8:00 PM didn’t leave me much time to truly unwind before everything shut down at 10:30 PM. I often felt rushed, especially if I wanted to watch a movie or relax.

So, I’m considering tweaking this rule. Instead of 7:00 AM to 8:00 PM, I’m thinking of shifting it to 8:00 AM to 7:00 PM. This way, I can have a bit more breathing room in the evening. If I still feel stressed this week, I might adjust it further to 6:00 PM. 

### A Look Back at My Week

I set some pretty clear daily goals for myself this month, starting with the first week. Here's a quick recap of those goals:

Looking at my week overview, I’d say I pretty much nailed it! But as I reflect on how things went, I see some room for improvement for the coming week.

### Planning for the Next Week

So, how will I tackle this week? Here are my updated rules:

```Markup
- **Evening Rules:**
    - Computer turns off at 10:00 PM.
    - Saturday-Wednesday: No phone after 10:30 PM (except for podcasts and sleep sounds).
    - Thursday-Friday: Relaxed phone rules, but still try to stick to the general guidelines.

- **During the Day Rules:**
    - No phone between 8:30 AM and 7:00 PM.
    - Relax after 7:00 PM.
    - Work at least 2x2 hours on the app.
    - Do 10 push-ups at some point during the day and log it.

- **Morning Rules:**
    - Start before 10:00 AM.
    - Begin the day with coffee and breakfast.
```

I'm excited to see how these tweaks will help me find a better balance between productivity and relaxation. Here's to another week of fine-tuning the art of living well!
