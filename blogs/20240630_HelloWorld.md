# Hello World!

I’ve just finished coding a tool that lets me easily write blog posts on my GitHub using Markdown. It even generates a related image automatically and displays everything in a clean, structured way on my website.

### Why this blog?

One of my goals is to write more about technology, along with my theories and general thoughts. I could keep postponing this and later regret not starting sooner, or I could just dive in and start writing. So, I’m finally doing it: I’ve started my blog! #Whoohoow!

To ensure I stick with this long-term, I’m starting simple. This blog will mostly serve as a personal notebook. Some posts might be casual and low-effort, while others might be more structured. The main goal is to write consistently, hopefully every day.

Some might ask: "Why start a blog when everyone else is doing it? It’s not going to make you rich." But starting this blog has many reasons, including:

1. It’s a logbook for myself—writing things down helps keep my mind calm.
2. I’ve always wanted to be a writer, ever since I was a child. I just keep postponing it...
3. It’s nice to be able to look back at previous posts.
4. I think I might have some interesting thoughts to share with others.
5. It motivates me (and hopefully others) to achieve more.
6. And there are plenty of other positive reasons...

While the blog itself might not make me rich, these positive effects could lead in the right direction.

### Why Markdown?

Now, why have I chosen to write in Markdown? And why have I chosen to create this system (the website + GitHub)? A couple of years ago, I had the idea to start a framework where people could blog using Markdown. I often get ideas like this, but I usually don’t execute them because I’m “wasting” my time with other things. Then, about six months ago, a friend mentioned this exact idea and said that others were looking for something similar. That motivated me to actually build it.

I chose Markdown because I see it being used more and more, especially in the engineering world. It’s an easy way to format text and code blocks with just a few symbols. Plus, I can quickly write in a README file and use tools like ChatGPT to structure it with titles and subtitles. Markdown also lets me share code blocks easily and helps me maintain a consistent design without thinking too much about it every time I write a post.

It’s getting late, so I’ll wrap up here.
