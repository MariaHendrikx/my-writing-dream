# How to use negative comments in business?

### **Turning Negativity into an Advantage**  

Criticism is an inevitable part of success. Whether you're launching a new business, sharing an idea, or excelling in your field, negativity will find its way to you. But instead of viewing it as a setback, what if you could **use it to your advantage**?  

Negative comments aren’t always a bad thing—they can be a **signal** that you’re onto something big.

> The key is knowing how to **interpret negativity** rather than simply react to it. If you can separate useful criticism from empty doubt, you’ll be able to **spot hidden opportunities, build confidence, and use negativity as a tool for validation rather than discouragement.**  

In this section, we’ll explore how negative feedback—whether it comes from jealousy, doubt, or outright dismissal—can actually serve as a **guiding force in business** rather than an obstacle.  

## **Using Negative Commentary to Validate Ideas**

Negative feedback can be **a signal** rather than an obstacle. People’s reactions can reveal **what they actually think**—sometimes more than they intend to.

### **A. If People Dismiss Your Idea, It Might Be a Good One**  
- When people say **"That won’t work"** or **"That’s not possible"**, it often means they simply **can’t picture how to build it**—but that doesn’t mean it won’t work.  
    - If you’re working on something truly **innovative or unconventional**, skepticism is actually a positive sign. It suggests you see something **others don’t** yet.  

- On the other hand, if people **immediately understand and love your idea**, it’s likely **too obvious** and probably **already exists**.  
    - But that’s not necessarily a bad thing—it means there’s **clear demand**, and people are already searching for it.  
> **Both Enthusiasm and Criticism Are Signals—They Just Lead to Different Business Models**
>
> Whether people dismiss your idea or embrace it, both reactions have value.  
> - **Criticism often indicates innovation**—your job is to prove it works.  
> - **Enthusiasm indicates market readiness**—your job is to execute and differentiate.  
>
> The key is to recognize that **negativity doesn’t mean failure, and instant excitement doesn’t mean guaranteed success**—they just suggest different approaches.  


### **B. If People Are Jealous, You're Probably Onto Something**
- Jealousy often comes from people **wishing they could do what you’re doing**.
- If people start **undermining your success** instead of giving real feedback, **it might mean you're ahead**.

### **C. If Nobody Hates It, Nobody Cares**
- The worst reaction to a product is **indifference, not hate**.
- If people argue about your idea, it means it’s **important**.


## Building a Resilient Mindset in Business**
- Entrepreneurs face negativity **constantly**. The key is **not letting it stop you**.
- The best **defense against negativity** is **traction**. If people use your product, **opinions don’t matter**.

- Train yourself to see negativity as **a data point, not a roadblock**.
- Ask: **"Is this criticism logical or emotional?"** and adjust accordingly.


# Believe in yourself
Both negative and positive comments have pros and cons. If the idea  gets a lot of positive feedback, it probably means people can imagine it themselves and are more likely to search for it or use it.

-  **Negative comments** might mean you know something they can't imagine themselves. It doesn't necessarily mean it is really bad. It is good for future ideas
-  **Positive comments** means they can imagine it themselves, which means they might search for it themselves.

You need both. If people completely can't imagine it, they won't search it, which means nobody will use your product. It means the market is not yet ready for it. VR is an example of this imo. VR and AR has a TREMENDOUS amount of potential to make life better for people. The amount of things you can create with VR/AR... 

But... In a couple of years, VR/AR will probably be a huge hit. Because people need time to see the use of something and integrate it into their lives.


# Conclusion

This is why **recognizing and rejecting this type of criticism is crucial**. If you let others define your limits, you may unknowingly lower your own potential. The best way to counter it is to **trust yourself, focus on actual results, and surround yourself with people who genuinely support growth**—not those who try to hold you back.
