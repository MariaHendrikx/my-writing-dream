# End of the "Productivity" Challenge: A 30-Day Reflection

It’s been 30 days since I embarked on my "socially resetting" challenge. Let’s take a look back at how it went.

### Recap
Here’s what I committed to over the last month:

```
### Daily Goals

So, what am I not allowed to do this month (starting with this week)?

- No Facebook, Instagram, X (formerly Twitter), or TikTok.
- No initiating messages to people who aren’t work-related.
- My computer will automatically shut off between 10:30 PM and 6:00 AM.
- No games.

And what should I do every day?

- Eat breakfast between 6:00 AM and 9:00 AM.
- Eat lunch between 11:00 AM and 1:00 PM.
- Eat dinner between 5:00 PM and 7:00 PM.
- Work for at least 2 sessions of 2 hours each on my app.

### Monthly Goal

What do I want to achieve after one month of doing this?

- Less overthinking.
- Less doomscrolling.
- A more structured life.
- Completion of the ToddlersStories app:
    - Finished app.
    - Tested by four people.
    - Feedback implemented.
    - Payment system added.
```

## Did it work?

Overall, this challenge had a positive impact on me. If you look at my GitHub contributions from this past month, you can clearly see a productivity spike compared to previous months. I’m incredibly proud of that.

## Challenges encountered

While this challenge led to some great results, it wasn’t without its difficulties. Here are a few of the hurdles I encountered:

1. **Energy and motivation dips**: I started the challenge feeling highly motivated, but after the first week, I began to experience significant fatigue. Maintaining that initial drive became harder, and I noticed that, by the final week, I was slipping into old habits—sleeping poorly, getting less done, and struggling with focus. Although I still managed to work at least two hours a day on my app, my efficiency took a hit.
   
2. **Breaking the routine**: One of the biggest challenges was staying disciplined with my computer shut-off time. It worked well for the first 2-3 weeks, but towards the end, I found myself ignoring it. The fatigue seemed to play a role here—I wasn’t going to bed earlier but instead just stayed up in unproductive ways, which impacted my energy the next day.
   
3. **Social interaction adjustments**: Reducing non-work-related messages was another tricky area. Although I managed to cut down, I didn’t eliminate it entirely, which caused some lingering overthinking and a feeling of distraction. The reduction helped, but I noticed how tough it is to fully break these ingrained habits of reaching out.

4. **Sleep struggles**: Improving my sleep schedule was a side-goal that I wasn’t able to achieve. Despite adding more structure to my daily routine, my nights remained inconsistent. I’m still not sure why my sleep pattern didn’t improve, and this is something I plan to focus on moving forward.

## Did I achieve my goals?

For the most part, yes! The social media detox worked well. I stayed away from Facebook and Instagram for the entire month and plan to continue this detox until the Toddler Stories app is fully completed. I’m happy to say that I’m doomscrolling a lot less, and I’ve noticed a real drop in overthinking—two of my biggest wins from this challenge.

The **Toddler Stories app** is nearly finished. There are still a few details to iron out—like adding the payment system and incorporating user feedback—but overall, the app is in great shape. I’m proud of the progress made so far.

The one area I didn’t fully stick to was the **"No initiating non-work-related messages"** rule. While I didn’t manage to eliminate all unnecessary communication, I did reduce it significantly, so I consider this a partial win.

## Final thoughts

All in all, I consider this challenge a success. I’ve made great progress with my app, cut down on unhealthy habits, and brought more structure into my life. There’s still work to be done, especially when it comes to improving my sleep, but I’m confident that I’ll continue refining these routines over time.

**Mission accomplished!**

# What's next?

I considered the challenge officially done yesterday. To mark that, I reinstalled Dota2, which I had put on hold for the month. Initially, I thought about extending my no-gaming rule, but after discussing it with a friend, I decided to give myself a two-day break to play before jumping back into my next challenge (that I will think about after this).

Right now, I’m feeling pretty exhausted—possibly on the verge of getting sick—so I took a step back to relax. But overall, the desire to keep working on my app is stronger than ever.
