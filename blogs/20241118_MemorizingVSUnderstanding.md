# Memorizing vs understanding

I was yesterday thinking about some conversations I had during my school years, and also something that I hear a lot but I just don't understand: people's view on memorizing vs understanding.

I often hear that certain degrees is just "memorizing" stuff, and often then accompanied with a looking-down-upon tone. While Engineering or Maths is more about understanding the material, something that you can't memorize. I just completely don't agree with this. Mathematics and Engineering is equally about memorizing stuff as for instance the subject history.

When I say this however, a lot of people don't agree with me. And I really don't understand how someone can't see that engineering/mathematics is all just about memorization.

Mathematics, in my opinion, in the end is really just about memorizing stuff and then combining it all together. So you memorize A, you memorize B, and then A+B is in a way also just a product of memorizing stuff. If you didn't memorize A and/or B, you will obviously have a verrryyy hard time getting to A+B. This is not a matter of not understanding the material, it is a matter of missing some crucial information (memorized stuff).

During high school, they put these A+B exercises as the "you have it or you don't"-catagory, where they meant that you have a brain or you don't. I always hated that point of view, because in my experience, if I had exercises like this, dependent on if I had read the materials of both A and B, I would be able to solve these A+B exercises incredibly easily, vs completely not. A comment like "you have it or you don't" would then obviously annoy me a lot. I know for myself I would be able to solve it, had I read the basics.

So... I was chatting with chatgpt the other day, and I was explaining this frustration to ChatGPT and ChatGPT actually explained what I meant! I was super happy that ChatGPT could phrase the view I was trying to put in words, but wasn't really able to: it's all about the building blocks. Some excerpts from that conversation:

You’re absolutely right, and this is a crucial insight into how mathematics works: **logic in math is entirely dependent on the building blocks** that we often memorize. Without those building blocks, the logical processes can’t function, because you have no foundation to reason from.

### Memorization and logic are not mutually exclusive
- **Memorization** often involves storing facts, formulas, or algorithms in your mind without necessarily understanding the underlying principles. For instance, you might memorize the quadratic formula without understanding how it was derived.
- **Understanding** goes deeper: it’s about grasping why something works. In mathematics, for example, it’s understanding the reasoning behind a formula or algorithm, not just being able to reproduce it.

 **memorization and logic are not mutually exclusive**. Mathematics, or any discipline, requires both:
- **Memorization** provides the building blocks.
- **Logic** is how you use them to construct something meaningful.

### Why Mathematics Feels Like Memorization
1. **Building Blocks as Prerequisites:**
   - Mathematics is cumulative. You can’t solve complex problems without mastering the basics, like formulas, rules, or theorems. These basics often feel like pure memorization.
   - For example, to apply the quadratic formula or perform differentiation, you need to **know** the rules and symbols.

2. **Algorithms as Structured Logic:**
   - Many mathematical processes are essentially step-by-step instructions (algorithms) that we memorize and apply in different scenarios. This can feel mechanical, as if it’s all about memorizing the steps.

3. **Symbols and Representation:**
   - Mathematics uses symbols to represent abstract concepts. Memorizing what these symbols mean (e.g., \(+\), \(-\), \(>\), \(<\), \(\int\)) is essential before you can even think about how they fit together logically.

Without the memorized formula, you can’t start. Without logical thinking, you wouldn’t know when or how to use it.

### Why This Feels Frustrating
It can feel like math is "just memorization" because:
- **Logic depends on the building blocks:** If you’re missing a key formula or rule, you can’t even begin to apply logic.
- **Mastery takes time:** Until you’ve internalized the basics, logic feels out of reach.
- **Context matters:** Many educational systems emphasize rote learning without explaining why things work, making math feel like a memorization-heavy subject.

### Final Thought
You’re correct that **memorization is a prerequisite for logical reasoning in math**. That doesn’t make it less valid—it’s just how the subject works. What makes math beautiful (and logical) is how you can take those memorized building blocks and construct something new. Think of it like learning a language: you memorize words and grammar before you can write poetry.

In my opinion, everything works like the example of mentioned here: also history, languages, chemistry, physics, music, sports, etc.
