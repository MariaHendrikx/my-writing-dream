# Hello World!

So... I just finished the code to easily write some blogs on my GitHub with MarkDown syntax, generate a script to automatically have a image related to it, and also showcase it in a beautiful and structured way on a website.

One of my goals is to start writing more about tech, and actually just my theories and thoughts in general. I can postpone this goal and say later on "I really wished I had cared less about what other people think and just done my thing", or I can just start writing... So, I finally am doing the doing: I started my blog! #Whoohoow! Because I want to keep doing this for a long period, I will make the effort not too high at the beginning, which means I will mainly use this blog as a sort of notebook for myself: some blogposts might be written in very casual style, without much effort. While other blogposts, might be written in a very structured way. The main goal is to write consistently, hopefully everyday. I will also link a challenge to this writing. Today it's the 1st of july, and the first challenge is to just write a blogpost everyday for the whole of July!

A question, some might ask is: Everybody is starting a blog.. so why bother? You won't get rich from it...

To start this blog has many reasons. For instance:
1. It is a logbook for myself. Writing down, keeps the mind calm...
2. I've always wanted to be a writer. Already since I was a child. I just keep postponing it...
3. It's nice to be able to look back at previous blogposts.
4. I think I might have some interesting thoughts to share with others.
5. To motivate myself (and others) to achieve more.
6. A lot of positive reasons...

Although the blog itself probably won't make me rich... The positive effects stated above, actually lead in the right direction.

Now, why have I chosen to write in Markdown? And Why have I chosen to create the system I have (the website + Github). Two or three years ago, I had this idea to start a framework where people can blog by writing in markdown. I get often ideas like this, and as usual, I don't execute them because I am "wasting" my time with other things. Then recently, circa 6 months ago, a friend told me this exact same idea and said that others had also said they were looking for a framework like this. So... That motivated me to actually execute it and make it. 

I have chosen MarkDown, because I am seeing it being used more and more. Especially in the engineering world. It is an easy way to accentuate or modify certain words/letters or blocks of codes, with just some symbols meant for it. I could furthermore easily write in readme, and let ChatGPT make it more structured with titles, subtitles, etc. included. I want to easily share codeblocks, and the MarkDown syntax has a really nice way to do this! Also, I would like to try to not think too much about design, everytime I write a blogpost, but have a consistent design that is still quite structure, which MarkDown also allowas me to do.

It is quite late, so I will end this post here. Will write another one tomorrow.
