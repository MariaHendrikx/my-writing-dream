# Making some basic stuff with AI to learn

So, I was looking at Personalized text to Image 3, and I figured that I never really made my own deep learning code decently. I have been in groupwork during uni, but since I mainly got these in my masters, I was mainly focused on other stuff and less on school. This means, I never really got to fully understand it and it still annoys me to today. 

So.. Today I want to cross of my todo of making some simple code to play some simple games, where an AI wins the game, and I understand why.

Video I will base myself on: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CI3FRsSAa_U&ab_channel=Chrispresso

# Alright... Let's code!
