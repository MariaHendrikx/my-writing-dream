# Review of Today

So.. today I tried following the plan that ChatGPT suggested me to do. On top of that I also went for a 10km run, because I was feeling energetic. 

### Vanilla CSS = <3

Today I was quite productive, did quite a while on making the portfolio beautiful, especially the animation when hovering a video I spent some time on (2-3 hours). I also got reminded today, that I am considering not using frameworks such as Vuetify, because I tend to achieve a better and quicker result with CSS. With Vuetify and other frameworks I always end up wanting something specific, what they don't offer, and then having to use CSS anyway, which makes my code contain both Vuetify, some other framework, and some CSS... So a bit everything, which makes the code more cluttered, something I like to avoid.

### Digging up Old Projects

Once I uploaded my youtube videos from my conservatory years, I wanted to add my projects of my computer science bachelor years. I had put them on a disk, but never really made screenshots of them. So I just took the opportunity to try to run these projects again and make some screenshots I can use for my portfolio. I kept the Object-Oriented-Programming-Programming for tomorrow, because I thought it might take some time to run it. So, I started with the next project: web programming. This was quite interesting to get running again. It was made in PHP, and for some reason I thought PHP was like python, where you install some package, and then just run it with a command. Apparently it can only run on a webserver such as apache... So I could choose to install apache and PHP seperately, or just instsall xxamp... After looking a bit into both option, xxamp seemed to be the most easy option.

Now that I am a bit more progressed in my computer science knowledge, it's also interesting to look back at these projects and then also to understand PHP better. Running my website I made back then, was quite a hassle, the project did have some bugs :P but Lucky me, ChatGPT can solve them quickly. I took some screenshots, and that's it for today.

Back tomorrow!
