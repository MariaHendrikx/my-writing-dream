# Am a bit ... # Overexcited!

So... Two days ago, I started this new challenge to socially reset. I can happyily say that this challenge is going well. The past 3 days I have been incredibly productive and the funny thing is: I get super excited by being productive. a little bit... too excited! So excited that I constantly feel like I want to go for a run. So excited that I can barely sit down behind my laptop and do the things I wanna do... that excited!

On the first full day I did the challenge (so 24/08/2024), I worked a total of 9h30 on my apps! And also I spent 1 hour on running that day... So, incredibly productive. The day afterwards I did a total of circa 6 hours and 1 hours of sport. Today I did so far a total of 3h40min, but I still have the whole evening in front of me. The new financial/academic year is also starting, and as part of my new "I need structure", I have also registered for a running club. In 30 minutes is my first training, and the running club offers 3 times running in group per week, with exercises to improve the correct muscles etc. So I am quite happy, I will start this hobby. At this moment, I actually just want to code all day, but I know I will not sustain that for longer than a week probably, I need some varierty, and atm I am running by myself, so why not combine it with some social interaction (not my friends). Also to note: this kind of social interaction is allowed, because it's part of a hobby, which gives structure. And it's not "going out", it's "going to a hobby, where also people are".

I also made a lot of progress with my EBookCreator. It's almost finished. Which is probably a dangerous thing to say, because these last small bits sometimes take a lot of time to finish...

Anyway.. Because I am soo excited.. I can also feel that I am losing grip on what to do next. Which is why I thought: let's write a blog and reflect on my next steps.

### Next steps

So. What are the next steps?
When looking at the app:

- [ ]  Html to Epub
    - [ ] Both have: create zip with browser vs. with node.
    - [ ] Save the images inside the epub-file
    - [ ] Have a system to copy the whole page (+style) to the epub
    - [ ] Transform the images to have 200-300 dpi on average for average ebook-reader-size.
- [ ] Finish the input/toolbar (or find a temporary free toolbar)
- [ ] Put the html-to-epub in backend
- [ ] Implement Generate-AI-book
- [ ] Put paypall and payment options

Optional
- [ ] Make the position of the image moveable (and resizable)

When asking ChatGPT to finish my todo list, it suggest the following. ChatGPT actually added a lot more, but I removed the ones that I don't consider crucial/want to implement.

- **Html to Epub**
    - [ ] **Support for ePub3**: Ensure compatibility with ePub3 format, allowing for enhanced interactivity, multimedia support, and better accessibility features.
    - [ ] **Custom Metadata Handling**: Allow users to add/edit custom metadata (author, title, language, etc.) within the HTML before conversion.
    - [ ] **Footnote and Endnote Support**: Ability to convert footnotes and endnotes in HTML to their corresponding locations in the ePub format.

- **Finish the Input/Toolbar**

- **Put the HTML-to-EPUB in Backend**
    - [ ] **Scalable Backend Architecture**: Design the backend to handle large-scale conversions efficiently, with the ability to queue and manage multiple requests.
    - [ ] **Validation and Error Reporting**: Implement ePub validation on the backend to ensure the output is compliant with ePub standards, providing users with detailed error reports if issues are detected.

- **Implement Generate-AI-Book**
    - [ ] **Content Generation Customization**: Allow users to customize AI-generated content by specifying the genre, tone, style, and chapter structure.
    - [ ] **AI-Powered Editing Suggestions**: Provide AI-driven grammar and style suggestions for user-generated content, improving the overall quality of the ePub.

- **Put PayPal and Payment Options**
    - [ ] **Subscription Model**: Offer a subscription-based payment model for accessing premium features like AI book generation, advanced templates, and cloud storage.
    - [ ] **One-Time Purchase for ePub Generation**: Allow users to pay per ePub generation if they don't want a subscription.
    - [ ] **Discount Codes and Promotions**: Implement support for discount codes, coupons, and promotions to attract more users.

### Optional Enhancements

    - [ ] **Grid-Based Layout Editor**: Offer a grid-based layout editor for precise image placement and resizing, giving users greater control over their ePub design.
    - [ ] **Image Captioning and Styling**: Allow users to add captions, borders, and styles to images, ensuring they align with the overall design theme.

### Additional Crucial Features to Consider

    - [ ] **Save Projects to Cloud**: Provide options to save and sync projects across devices via cloud storage (e.g., Google Drive, Dropbox).
    - [ ] **Auto-Save Feature**: Implement an auto-save feature that periodically saves the user’s progress to prevent data loss.

    - [ ] **Feedback and Reviews Integration**: Allow readers to leave feedback and ratings directly within the ePub if it’s published and distributed through your platform.
