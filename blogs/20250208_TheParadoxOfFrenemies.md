# Frenemies - The Paradox of Competition in Business: How Competition Validates AI Story Book

Every time I start creating a new product, I hear the phrase "But that already exists" or "But an idea should be original". These statements drive me crazy to be honest, because when I hear them, I think "Damn, these people don't understand business/people/the world at all". I also often then get discouraged to explain to them why these statements are *COMPLETELY* idiotic. One reason is because it doesn't matter if I give them an incredibly good explanation, they will still argue I am wrong. ~~ Note on that: I should probably work on my skill of persuasion. I think it's called rhetorica, or the art of public speaking (Ars oratoria).

Another reason why I get discouraged is because I am not really able to pinpoint why they are wrong, but I just know 100% they are wrong. Today it came to my mind, why they are wrong, with some examples. I will try my best to explain it as good as possible.

So.. What is the best way to explain something? Well.. With an example.

We could explain: Pepsi vs. Coca Cola, or we could just take this article I am writing now.

### Examples

#### Competing Articles

I am now writing this article, and maybe at the end of this article you are like: "yeah yeah..., I don't believe the theory you are presenting". But then tomorrow you see some other articles saying a similar thing as what I am saying. Or maybe you entered this article because you read something similar on a different page and you were looking for validation? I could even try to search for articles that sort of say the same thing as what I am saying now, and then just add them as sources at the end of this article.

These articles I am mentioning, could be seen as "competing" articles, because suddenly I am not "Unique" anymore. 

But because of these articles...  you would suddenly be like: "ooh, there is more than 1 person saying this?" And then you would suddenly start believing this article more as well. If these competing articles come from respected people, you would believe the theory even more...

But ok, let's take the example of pepsi and coca cola.

#### Coca Cola didn't thrive until it got competition

Coca-Cola was originally the **only** one offering its specific cola formula when it was created in **1886** by Dr. John Stith Pemberton. At that time, there were no direct competitors making a similar **carbonated caramel-colored cola drink**.

For a while, Coca-Cola had a **monopoly on the cola category**, and while it was successful, the market was relatively small. The lack of competition meant fewer people were exposed to cola as a drink option, and innovation was slow.

It wasn’t until **Pepsi was introduced in 1893** (under the name "Brad’s Drink") and later formally rebranded as **Pepsi-Cola in 1898** that the cola industry truly began to **expand and thrive**. The competition between Coca-Cola and Pepsi led to:
- **Massive marketing campaigns** (Coca-Cola’s Santa Claus and Pepsi’s taste tests)
- **Product diversification** (Diet Coke, Pepsi Max, etc.)
- **Global expansion efforts** to capture more markets

So while Coca-Cola once stood alone, it wasn’t until competitors entered the market that the **cola industry grew into the global giant it is today**. If Coca-Cola had remained the only cola drink, it might have stayed a **niche product** rather than becoming one of the **most recognized brands in history**.

This is why **competition is essential**—it **validates**, expands, and improves industries instead of destroying them.

### AI Story Book and the Rise of Similar Apps

I started AI Story Book around eight months ago, and I knew similar apps would rise. At the time, I couldn’t really find much competition (maybe I didn’t search well enough), but I knew—because the idea is so simple and obvious—that a lot of competition would eventually come.

Now, when I search for similar apps to AI Story Book... I can find A LOT. AI Story Book is just one of many.

And what do I think of this? Well, these other apps are displaying their numbers of clients, and it just proves to me that the idea works. People are warming up to the concept. They are seeing that AI-generated storybooks are a thing, and that alone validates the market. They might try a similar app and think "I like it, but I am just looking for a little bit different implementation", then they find AI Story Book and it might just be it what they were searching for, or the closest to what they were searching for...

### Conclusion: Competition is good

This is why competition is essential—it validates, expands, and improves industries instead of destroying them. The presence of many AI storybook apps is a sign that this space is worth pursuing. It proves that people understand and want AI-generated stories. Instead of fearing competition, embracing it as a growth driver allows AI Story Book to evolve and refine its offering.

The key is not just to exist in a competitive space, but to lead it. And that’s exactly what we intend to do.
