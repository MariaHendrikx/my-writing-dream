# The Launch Challenge: One Step Closer to Toddler Stories

## The Journey So Far

On August 23rd, I started a challenge to boost my productivity. The goal was to make substantial progress on my app, Toddler Stories, aiming for a presentable version by September 30th. Although the original target was to finish the app by August 23rd, I took a more flexible approach, focusing on user feedback and iterations, which I’m thrilled to have implemented. Now, it’s time for the next phase: launching.

I’ve taken some well-deserved downtime over the past few days, playing games guilt-free. But now, I’m ready to get back into the groove. The productivity challenge really helped me maintain focus last time, so here I am, starting another one—only this time, the goal is tougher: the app needs to be launched.

## The New Challenge

### Daily Commitments

To make this happen, I’m setting clear boundaries and daily goals to stay focused.

#### What I’m *Not* Allowed to Do

- No social media (Facebook, Instagram, X, TikTok) until app is launched.
- No initiating non-work messages between 8 AM and 5 PM.
- No games
- My computer shuts down between 10:30 PM and 6:00 AM to maintain a healthy schedule.
- Start each workday with a journal entry (even if it’s just a sentence).

#### Nutrition & Routine

- **Breakfast:** Immediately after waking up, I’ll have cornflakes and 1-2 yoghurts.
- **Lunch:** Preparation begins at 11:30 AM. It will include:
  - One type of meat
  - At least one vegetable (frozen packs, tomatoes, cucumber, aubergines)
  - A staple (rice, potatoes, bread, or pasta)
- **Dinner:** Preparation starts at 6:00 PM (or after running).
  - Either lunch leftovers or cornflakes with yoghurt
  - Pasta with meat on Mondays and Thursdays

#### Work on Toddler Stories

- **Daily App Development:** At least two focused sessions of 2 hours each dedicated to the app.

### The Monthly Goal

What am I aiming to achieve by the end of this month?

- **A More Structured Life**: Developing daily habits to maintain balance and productivity.
- **Launch-Ready Toddler Stories App**:
  - Integrate the payment system.
  - Complete all app features.
  - Launch the app to the public.
  - Test the launched version with at least four users.
- **Optional Features**:
  - Add a login system.
  - Build a library feature for users to display their created books.
  - Implement a subscription system.

The goal is straightforward but ambitious: to get Toddler Stories from "almost there" to "out in the world." By creating structured habits and setting clear boundaries, I hope to not only launch the app but also cultivate a healthier work-life rhythm.

Here’s to a productive month and, hopefully, a successful launch!
