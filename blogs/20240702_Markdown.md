# Understanding Markdown: How It Works Behind the Scenes

## Introduction
Markdown has become a go-to format for writing content on the web. It's widely used due to its simplicity and readability. But what happens when you write in Markdown? How does it get converted into the formatted text we see on websites and documents? In this blog post, we'll explore the inner workings of Markdown.

### What is Markdown?
Markdown is a lightweight markup language created by John Gruber and Aaron Swartz in 2004. It allows you to format text using a simple, readable syntax that can be easily converted to HTML.
Markdown uses plain text formatting conventions to create various elements like headers, lists, links, and more. Here's a quick overview of some common Markdown syntax:

  ```markdown
# This is a heading

This is a paragraph with **bold** and *italic* text.

- Item 1
- Item 2

  ```

### Extending Markdown
Markdown can be extended with plugins to add additional functionality or custom syntax. Some common extensions include:
- **GitHub Flavored Markdown (GFM)**: Adds features like task lists, tables, and strikethroughs.
- **MathJax**: Allows the inclusion of mathematical notation using LaTeX.

### Common Use Cases for Markdown
Markdown is used in various scenarios, including:
- **Documentation**: Easy-to-read and write syntax makes it ideal for software documentation.
- **Blogging**: Many static site generators, like Jekyll and Hugo, support Markdown.
- **ReadMe Files**: Commonly used for README files in GitHub repositories.

# Behind the Scenes of Markdown

Alright, so we know that Markdown is used by OpenAI to display it's text when chatting with their chatapplication. Also, we can see that GitHub has an built-in readme-display. But why is it displayed in that way? What ifwe want to implement it for our own blog? How to implement it in a website? In this article, we will explain the technical details of Markdown.

## Markdown Parsing and Rendering
When you write in Markdown, it's just plain text. For it to be displayed as formatted text (like HTML), it needs to be parsed and rendered. Here's a look at how this process works. We will first give an overview, and then go into more detail with some very simplified python code.

### Parsing Markdown

1. **Lexer (Tokenizer)**: The first step is tokenizing the input. The lexer scans the text and breaks it down into tokens, which are the smallest units of meaning, such as words, punctuation, or syntax symbols.
2. **Parser**: The parser takes these tokens and builds the AST. The AST is a tree structure where each node represents a different element of the Markdown text (e.g., paragraphs, headers, lists).
### Rendering Markdown
1. **Tree Traversal**: The renderer traverses the AST and converts each node into the corresponding HTML element.
2. **HTML Generation**: The renderer produces the final HTML string by concatenating the HTML elements generated during the traversal.


## Step 1: parsing
Let's parse the following Markdown:
```markdown
# This is a heading

This is a paragraph with **bold** and *italic* text.

- Item 1
- Item 2

```
### Tokenization and Analysis

The first step is tokenizing the input. The lexer scans the text and breaks it down into tokens, which are the smallest units of meaning, such as words, punctuation, or syntax symbols.

Example code of tokenization
```Python
import re

def tokenize_markdown(text):
    tokens = []
    lines = text.split('\n')
    
    for line in lines:
        line = line.strip()
        
        if not line:
            continue
        
        # Match headings
        if line.startswith('#'):
            heading_level = len(re.match(r'^#+', line).group(0))
            heading_text = line[heading_level:].strip()
            tokens.append(('HEADING', heading_level, heading_text))
        
        # Match list items
        elif line.startswith('- '):
            item_text = line[2:].strip()
            tokens.append(('LIST_ITEM', item_text))
        
        # Match bold and italic text within paragraphs
        else:
            # Match links
            line = re.sub(r'\[([^\]]+)\]\(([^)]+)\)', r'LINK(\1, \2)', line)
            
            # Match bold text
            line = re.sub(r'\*\*([^\*]+)\*\*', r'BOLD(\1)', line)
            
            # Match italic text
            line = re.sub(r'\*([^\*]+)\*', r'ITALIC(\1)', line)
            
            tokens.append(('PARAGRAPH', line))
    
    return tokens
```
```Python
# Example usage
markdown_text = """# This is a heading

This is a paragraph with **bold** and *italic* text.

- Item 1
- Item 2

[OpenAI](https://www.openai.com)"""

tokens = tokenize_markdown(markdown_text)
for token in tokens:
    print(token)
```

Will result in 
```Python
('HEADING', 1, 'This is a heading')
('PARAGRAPH', 'This is a paragraph with BOLD(bold) and ITALIC(italic) text.')
('LIST_ITEM', 'Item 1')
('LIST_ITEM', 'Item 2')
('PARAGRAPH', 'LINK(OpenAI, https://www.openai.com)')
```

### Buidling AST-Tree

Once the text has been tokenized, an AST tree is build.


```Python
# Define the AST node class
class ASTNode:
    def __init__(self, type, value=None, children=None):
        self.type = type
        self.value = value
        self.children = children if children is not None else []

    def __repr__(self):
        return f'ASTNode(type={self.type}, value={self.value}, children={self.children})'


# Build the AST from the tokens
def build_ast(tokens):
    root = ASTNode('DOCUMENT')
    current_parent = root

    for token in tokens:
        type = token[0]

        if type == 'HEADING':
            level, text = token[1], token[2]
            node = ASTNode('HEADING', value={'level': level, 'text': text})
            current_parent.children.append(node)
        
        elif type == 'LIST_ITEM':
            item_text = token[1]
            node = ASTNode('LIST_ITEM', value=item_text)
            current_parent.children.append(node)
        
        elif type == 'PARAGRAPH':
            text = token[1]
            node = ASTNode('PARAGRAPH', value=text)
            current_parent.children.append(node)
    
    return root
```
```Python
# Example usage
markdown_text = """# This is a heading

This is a paragraph with **bold** and *italic* text.

- Item 1
- Item 2

[OpenAI](https://www.openai.com)"""

tokens = tokenize_markdown(markdown_text) # Previous step
ast = build_ast(tokens) # Current step
```
Which will result in a tree, as illustrated below:

![alt text](image_url)


## Step 2: Rendering
Now that the AST-tree has been made, this tree can be used to create a different kind of output that internet is familiar with: HTML. In the code below, we are demonstrating how this could be done.

### Tree Traversal & HTML Generation


```Python
# Function to perform tree traversal and generate HTML
def render_ast_to_html(node):
    if node.type == 'DOCUMENT':
        return ''.join(render_ast_to_html(child) for child in node.children)
    
    elif node.type == 'HEADING':
        level = node.value['level']
        text = node.value['text']
        return f'<h{level}>{text}</h{level}>\n'
    
    elif node.type == 'LIST_ITEM':
        text = node.value
        return f'<li>{text}</li>\n'
    
    elif node.type == 'PARAGRAPH':
        text = node.value
        return f'<p>{text}</p>\n'
    
    elif node.type == 'IMAGE':
        alt_text = node.value['alt']
        image_url = node.value['url']
        return f'<img src="{image_url}" alt="{alt_text}">\n'
    
    # Handle any other node types gracefully
    return ''
```

```Python
# Example Usage
# Function to generate complete HTML from markdown text
def markdown_to_html(markdown_text):
    tokens = tokenize_markdown(markdown_text) # first step
    ast = build_ast(tokens) # second step
    html_content = render_ast_to_html(ast) # third step
    return html_content

# Example usage
markdown_text = """# This is a heading

This is a paragraph with **bold** and *italic* text.

- Item 1
- Item 2

![OpenAI Logo](https://www.openai.com/assets/img/logo.svg)
"""

html_output = markdown_to_html(markdown_text)
print(html_output)
```

## End note

In this example we created some very easy, simplified code to understand how Markdown works behind the scenes. If you are interested in seeing how a more complex, finished and everything included code would look like, I would suggest to look at the open-source GitHub repositories of [marked](https://github.com/markedjs/marked) or [markdown-it](https://github.com/markdown-it/markdown-it).



### Conclusion
Markdown is a powerful yet simple tool that has revolutionized the way we write and format text on the web. Understanding the parsing and rendering process gives us a deeper appreciation of how Markdown works behind the scenes. Whether you're writing documentation, a blog post, or a README file, Markdown's simplicity and flexibility make it an invaluable tool.
