# Day 14

Previous week I was visiting some friends and family in my home country. Which also means, I had less time to work on my own project. Now I am back in Copenhagen, so... back to concentration and productivity!

## Structure

- simplifying:
    - style (have 1 style)
    - story freedom (1 template)

1. Upload an image
