# Why I am a proud (former) musician

So, today I was looking at some former fellow students of my violin life. And I always feel sooooo grateful for having studied violin and am so proud I am part of this "music and scientist"-group. Was thinking to write a couple of blog posts around my experience as a (former) musician and how it has shaped me to the person I am today.
